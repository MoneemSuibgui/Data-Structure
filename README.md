## Singly Linked List :
##### Objectives:
```
Practice creating classes and objects
Learn and implement a singly linked list in Java
```
##### Tasks:
```
--> Create a Node class
--> Fill in the constructor method that sets the value to a given number and next to null of your Node objects
--> Create a SinglyLinkedList class like the above.
--> Create a constructor method that sets the head to null of your SinglyLinkedList objects
--> Create a remove() method that will remove a node from the end of your list
--> Create printValues() method that will print all the values of each node in the list in order
--> Create a ListTester class like the above
```
###### Optional Challenges:
```
--> Implement a find(int) method that will return the first node with the value in the parameter
--> Implement a removeAt(int) method that will remove the node after n nodes, where n is the parameter.
    For example, if n is 0, remove the first node. If n is 1, remove the second node. Similar to Arrays.
```


## Doubly Linked List :
##### Objectives:
```
Construct a doubly linked list using OOP
```
##### Tasks:
```
In Dll assignment, we will implement common methods for Doubly Linked Lists

--> void printValuesBackward(): This method prints the values of the nodes from the tail to the head.
--> Node pop(): This method removes the last node of our DLL and returns it.
--> boolean contains(Integer value): This method returns a boolean whether the value in the argument is in the list or not.
    Return true if the value exists, else, return false.
-> int size(): Returns the number of nodes in the list.
```
###### Optional Challenges:
```
--> void removeAt(int index): This method removes a node at an index. For example,
    let's say that we have 3 nodes in our list. If we call removeAt(1), the middle node is removed. (head is index 0)
--> boolean isPalindrome(): This method returns a boolean whether the list is a palindrome or not.
     Return true if it is a palindrome, else, return false.
```
